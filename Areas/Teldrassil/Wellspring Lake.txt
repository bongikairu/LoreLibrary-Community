Wellspring Lake is a small lake northeast of Darnassus and southeast of The Oracle Glade in Teldrassil.
Fed by a natural spring deep within the land of the World Tree, this small lake is drained by the Wellspring River.
Previously a favored spot for night elven fishermen, the lake is now the home of corrupted timberlings.
