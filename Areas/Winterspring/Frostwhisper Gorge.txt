Frostwhisper Gorge is a canyon in southern Winterspring, just north of Darkwhisper Gorge.
It is scattered with night elven ruins both at the bottom of the gorge and at the ridges above.
A great bridge to Darkwhisper Gorge spanned across the chasm until the Shattering destroyed it.

Several of the huge Frostmaul Preservers and Frostmaul Giants reside here, as well as Ice Avatars led by Frostilicus.
