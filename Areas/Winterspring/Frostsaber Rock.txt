Frostsaber Rock is a large jutting tor in the northern part of Winterspring.
This site is home to a great pride of wintersaber cats, ruled by the gargantuan female named Shy-Rotam

The Night Elves, who have an affinity with sabers, use the frostsabers as mounts and offer training to their Alliance friends.
