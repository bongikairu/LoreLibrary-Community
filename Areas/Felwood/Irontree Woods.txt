Irontree Woods, once a peaceful forest glade, has been corrupted like the rest of Felwood by the demonic presence of the Burning Legion.
Three Ancients - Hastat, Stoma and Vartrus, the great living trees of the night elves, have been petrified and remain permanently entombed within the Irontree Woods.
