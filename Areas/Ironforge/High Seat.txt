The High Seat is the former throne room of King Magni Bronzebeard in the dwarf city of Ironforge.
After Magni Bronzebeard was turned to diamond, the leadership of Ironforge was assumed by the Council of Three Hammers: his daughter Moira Thaurissan, his brother Muradin Bronzebeard, and Falstad Wildhammer.
